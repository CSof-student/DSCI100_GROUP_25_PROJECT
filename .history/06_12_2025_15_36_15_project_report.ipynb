    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report looks at two data sets from a Minecraft server set up by a computer science research group at the University of British Columbia. The researchers collected data about how people play games by recording players’ actions on the server. However, in order to run the project, the researchers need to figure out how to attract more players for their server and manage resources. One such method is to advertise on a game-related newsletter. Broadly, we looked at the types of players subscribed the the newsletter and on the server to determine which players the researchers should try to target with their efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will try to answer the following question: \n",
    "_Can we predict whether a player will subscribe to the game’s newsletter based on their age, total hours played and average session length?_\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer this question, we will use both the players data, which shows data about each of the players on the server, and sessions data, which shows data from individual sessions played by each player. Some details of the two datasets are listed below:\n",

    "- The low precision of our classifier poses a major issue for its utility in a practical setting. Our model tends to predict that many players who are in fact not subscribed ‘should be’ subscribed to the newsletter.\n",
    "- It is very clear that the KNN algorithm is very biased towards the majority class, predicting subscribed more often than it should. This is expected as the majority of the area on the plot is surrounded by more points (other players) that are subscribed than not, due to the nature of the imbalanced dataset.\n",
    "- The accuracy of the optimized model (67%) is less than the proportion of the majority class (72.7%), meaning it performs worse than a model that classifies every point as subscribed. This shows that the model has no predictive skill for this classification problem.\n",
    "- To improve the accuracy of our classifier, the researchers should try and collect more data on players who are not subscribed to the newsletter, to balance the proportion of subscribed vs unsubscribed. This would allow the model to have a better representative group of points for the non-subscribed class.\n",
    "- However, gathering more data of the non-subscribed class would be difficult as those who do not subscribe to gaming newsletters are probably less likely to be interested in gaming studies.\n",
    "- Overall, the low accuracy of our optimized KNN model means we are unable to make conclusions on the correlation of the predictors and subscription status. This was evident, as seen in the scatterplot visualizations, where there are no distinct ‘clusters’ of players who are subscribed or not subscribed.\n",
    "- Due to the low accuracy of our model, we couldn’t conclude the features of the type of players that are subscribed to the newsletter, thus showing our model is ineffective for the researchers’ predictive purposes.\n",
    "- If we had more prior knowledge, we would have explored other alternative classification algorithms and most likely would have selected one which can account for the imbalance in subscription status within the datasets. We would then be able to better determine if there is a correlation between our predictors and subscription status.\n",
