    "This report looks at two data sets from a Minecraft server set up by a computer science research group at the University of British Columbia. The researchers collected data about how people play games by recording players’ actions on the server. However, in order to run the project, the researchers need to figure out how to attract more players for their server and manage resources. One such method is to advertise on a game-related newsletter, but since not every player on the server is subscribed to it, it can limit their recruitment ability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will try to answer the following question: \n",
    "_Can we predict whether a player will subscribe to the game’s newsletter based on their age, total hours played and average session length?_\n",
