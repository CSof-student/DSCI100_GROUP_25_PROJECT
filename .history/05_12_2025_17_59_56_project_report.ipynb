    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report looks at two data sets from a Minecraft server set up by a computer science research group at the University of British Columbia. The researchers collected data about how people play games by recording players’ actions on the server. However, in order to run the project, the researchers need to figure out how to attract more players for their server and manage resources. One such method is to advertise on a game-related newsletter. Broadly, we looked at the types of players subscribed the the newsletter and on the server to determine which players the researchers should try to target with their efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will try to answer the following question: \n",
    "_Can we predict whether a player will subscribe to the game’s newsletter based on their age, total hours played and average session length?_\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer this question, we will use both the players data, which shows data about each of the players on the server, and sessions data, which shows data from individual sessions played by each player. Some details of the two datasets are listed below:\n",
